# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a growing issue in financial systems around the world. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques, with a focus on **imbalanced classification** problems and performance optimization.

I built this project to enhance my skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze and preprocess real-world credit card transaction data
- Handle imbalanced datasets using sampling techniques
- Train multiple machine learning models and compare performance
- Evaluate metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Visualize fraud patterns and model performance

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

- Contains 284,807 transactions
- 492 fraudulent transactions
- Features: anonymized using PCA (V1 to V28), `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- XGBoost (optional)
- Streamlit (optional deployment)

## 📊 Results

| Model              | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.91      | 0.63   | 0.75     | 0.96    |
| Random Forest       | 0.98      | 0.81   | 0.89     | 0.99    |
| XGBoost             | 0.99      | 0.84   | 0.91     | 0.99    |

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Accuracy alone is not sufficient for imbalanced datasets.
- Precision-Recall and ROC-AUC are more reliable for fraud detection.
- Random Forest and XGBoost perform best in this case.

---

## 🧠 Future Work

- Use deep learning methods (e.g., autoencoders, LSTM)
- Build a live fraud detection dashboard
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
